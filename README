This repository contains the source code used to create and run
http://www.wherearewe.org.uk.

There are two main parts:

* A Django application which receives a list of postcodes and produces a map of
  the UK, with constituencies coloured from light red to dark red depending on
  how many postcodes in that constituency were listed.

* A set of Python scripts which process the publicly-available data on UK
  postcodes and UK constituency boundaries, and insert that data into the
  Django database.


The raw data (postcodes, constituency boundaries) is available from
https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/ under the Open Government
License (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/).
